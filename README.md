# Binge: Meet and Eat

<kbd>![alt text](extension/icon128.png)</kbd>

## Overview

Binge is a web application with a Chrome extension agent that allows users to create profiles, save their favourite restaurants, and find potential matches based on shared interests and preferences. Once a match is found, the matched person's email address, name, and the restaurant of mutual interest are sent via email. The application offers a seamless user experience across both the Binge web platform and the Chrome extension while on Google Maps for restaurant searches.

## Features

- **Profile Management**: Users can create and manage their profiles.
- **Restaurant Management**: Save and manage favorite restaurants based on Google Maps listings.
- **Matching System**: Find potential matches based on user preferences and interests.
- **Email Notifications**: Users receive email notifications when matched with another user.
- **Chrome Extension**: A browser extension that allows users to easily save restaurants while browsing.

## Accessing the Program

Binge Web Page can be accessed at [http://www.bingeeating.study](http://www.bingeeating.study) or [https://deltahacks-git-main-sams-projects-71d5eb04.vercel.app/](https://deltahacks-git-main-sams-projects-71d5eb04.vercel.app/).

### Chrome Extension Installation

## User Profile Embeddings and Similarity Score Calculations

Cohere is used in the Binge application to create embeddings for user responses and calculate similarity scores between users. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### Creating Embeddings

1. **Embedding Generation**:
   - The `create_embeddings` function in `cohere_scripts.py` generates embeddings for various user responses related to relationship goals, affection expression, free time approach, motivation, and communication style.
   - Each response is embedded into a vector representation using Cohere's embedding model. This allows for a numerical representation of qualitative data, making it easier to compare user preferences.

2. **Embedding Structure**:
   - The embeddings are stored in a 3D NumPy array, where each dimension corresponds to a different question and its possible answers. This structure allows for efficient similarity calculations later on.

### Calculating Similarity Scores

1. **Cosine Similarity Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_similarity` function takes two vectors (representing two users' responses) as input.
   - It flattens the vectors to ensure they are one-dimensional and then calculates the cosine similarity between them.
   - Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors, defined as the cosine of the angle between them. It is computed using the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes.

2. **Return Similarity Score**:
   - The function returns a scalar value representing the similarity score, which ranges from -1 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (identical).
   - A higher similarity score indicates that the users have more in common based on their responses.
